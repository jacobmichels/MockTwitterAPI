# MockTwitterAPI

This is my implementation of Twitter's backend API for Speer.io's technical assessment. I choose to use ASP.NET Core for this project.

The documentation for how to use/test my API, along with some more information about the API is in a pdf located in the Docs directory.

Note: It appears that GitHub treats PDFs as images, and there are links in the PDF so I would recommend downloading a local copy of the PDF instead of viewing it in Github so you can click the links.
